Here’s a deduplicated summary of all the recurring error/warning types found in the logs you provided for your Sophos UTM 9 ↔ Azure VPN setup:

---

## **Summary of Error Types**

### 1. **INVALID_ID_INFORMATION**
- **Example:**  
  `cannot respond to IPsec SA request because no connection is known for ...`
- **Cause:**  
  Azure is negotiating a subnet pair (selector) that is not defined on the UTM.
- **Fix:**  
  Ensure both sides have matching subnet pairs (no extra or missing subnets).

---

### 2. **INVALID_MESSAGE_ID**
- **Example:**  
  `Quick Mode I1 message is unacceptable because it uses a previously used Message ID ...`
- **Cause:**  
  Duplicate/resent Quick Mode (phase 2) negotiation attempts, often due to previous failures.
- **Fix:**  
  Address the root cause (usually selector mismatch); this is a symptom of failed negotiations.

---

### 3. **INVALID_PAYLOAD_TYPE / ISAKMP_NEXT_HASH**
- **Example:**  
  `message ignored because it contains an unexpected payload type (ISAKMP_NEXT_HASH)`  
  `sending encrypted notification INVALID_PAYLOAD_TYPE ...`
- **Cause:**  
  Azure sends IKE payloads that Sophos UTM’s Pluto does not support.
- **Fix:**  
  Protocol mismatch—ignore unless persistent; best resolved by matching gateway types.

---

### 4. **ERROR: netlink XFRM_MSG_NEWPOLICY response ... errno 17: File exists**
- **Example:**  
  `ERROR: netlink XFRM_MSG_NEWPOLICY response ... errno 17: File exists`
- **Cause:**  
  Attempt to install a duplicate or overlapping kernel policy for a subnet pair.
- **Fix:**  
  Remove overlapping/duplicate selectors in UTM and Azure configs.

---

### 5. **IKE message has the Commit Flag set but Pluto doesn't implement this feature; ignoring flag**
- **Cause:**  
  Azure sends a flag during IKE negotiation that the Sophos UTM IPsec engine ("pluto") does not support.
- **Fix:**  
  Not critical—UTM ignores this. Seen in mixed/protocol-mismatch scenarios.

---

### 6. **DPD: No response from peer - declaring peer dead / Restarting all connections**
- **Example:**  
  `DPD: No response from peer - declaring peer dead`
- **Cause:**  
  Dead Peer Detection (DPD) sees no reply from the other end; triggers tunnel restart.
- **Fix:**  
  Usually caused by negotiation failures or network issues.

---

### 7. **packet ... Informational Exchange is for an unknown (expired?) SA**
- **Cause:**  
  Informational IKE message received for an SA that’s already expired or deleted.
- **Fix:**  
  Harmless, but symptomatic of tunnel instability or negotiation retries.

---

### 8. **IPsec SA expired (LATEST!)**
- **Cause:**  
  Security Association (SA) expired (either naturally or due to negotiation problems).
- **Fix:**  
  Typically a side effect of the above issues—tunnels flap as a result.
